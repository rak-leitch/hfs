Sample Laravel app for Article CRUD

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:rak-leitch/hfs.git
```
The app requires a database to be set up and configured, and the dependencies to be installed with composer. Once you have done this run the migrations.
At this point, you should be able to create an account, log in, and create/delete articles from the dashboard. A complete list of articles is available at /articles.
